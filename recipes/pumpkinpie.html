        <h3>Ingredients</h3>
        <ul>
            <li>1 9-inch homemade pie crust, or store-bought, deep dish, unbaked</li>
            <li>3/4 cup granulated sugar</li>
            <li>1 teaspoon ground cinnamon</li>
            <li>1/2 teaspoon salt</li>
            <li>1/2 teaspoon ground ginger</li>
            <li>1/4 teaspoon ground cloves</li>
            <li>2 large eggs</li>
            <li>15 ounce can canned pumpkin or fresh pumpkin puree</li>
            <li>12 ounce can evaporated milk</li>
        </ul>
        <h3>Steps</h3>
        <ol>
            <li>Make sure to preheat oven to 425 degrees F</li>
            <li>In a large bowl beat eggs and pumpkin puree together. In a separate bowl, add the sugar, cinnamon, salt, ginger, and cloves, and mix. Then add to pumpkin mixture.</li>
            <li>Gradually stir in the evaporated milk. Carefully pour mixture into unbaked pie shell. Make sure to tap the pie pan on countertop to remove air bubbles. </li>
            <li>Bake at 425 degrees F for 15 minutes. Reduce temperature to 350 F; bake for 40 to 50 minutes longer, or until the pie is set. Check for doneness by giving the pie a gentle wiggle. The center may jiggle just a tiny bit. It will continue to set up as it cools.</li>
            <li>Cool completely. Serve immediately with whipped cream. </li>
        </ol>
